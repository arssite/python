#Given a string n, your task is to find whether it contains an additive sequence or not. A string n contains an additive sequence if its digits can make a sequence of numbers in which every number is addition of previous two numbers. You are required to complete the function which returns true if the string is a valid sequence else returns false. For better understanding check the examples.
#Note: A valid string should contain at least three digit to make one additive sequence. 
'''Input:  
n = "1235813"
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
The given string can be splited into a series of numbers  
where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers: 
1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8, and 5 + 8 = 13. Hence, the output would be 1 (true).'''

'''Input:  
n = "11235815"
Output: 
0
Explanation: 
We can start with the first two digits: "11".
First number: 1, Second number: 1, Sum: 1 + 1 = 2
Now, we have "2" as the next number.
First number: 1, Second number: 2, Sum: 1 + 2 = 3
Now, we have "3" as the next number.
First number: 2, Second number: 3, Sum: 2 + 3 = 5
Now, we have "5" as the next number.
First number: 3, Second number: 5, Sum: 3 + 5 = 8
Now, we have "8" as the next number.
First number: 5, Second number: 8, Sum: 5 + 8 = 13
At this point, there is no "13" present in the remaining digits "815". Hence, the output would be 0 (or false).'''
